Web Components: Countdown Timer & Tabs
Overview
This repository contains custom Web Components for a Countdown Timer and Tabs Component. These components are designed to be easy to use and highly customizable, providing a simple and powerful way to integrate countdowns and tabs into any web project.

Key Features:
Countdown Timer

Flexible and supports multiple date formats (e.g., YYYY-MM-DD, DD/MM/YYYY, Month DD, YYYY).
Supports dynamic updates for days, hours, minutes, and seconds.
Allows customization via slots for labels (e.g., "Days", "Hours").
Automatically handles expired dates with a custom message.
Provides attributes for hiding days, hours, minutes, and seconds as needed.
Tabs Component

A simple and effective way to create tabbed content for your web applications.
Supports dynamic content updates and easy integration with minimal code.
Installation
To use the components, simply include the necessary JavaScript and CSS files by adding the following <script> and <link> tags to your HTML file.

html
Copy code
<!-- Include CSS -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Mohammedfouadd/web_component@cfa33415ec9b18bf6aa17c0014f63c71f96c479f/master.css">

These files will enable the use of both the Countdown Timer and Tabs components.

Countdown Timer Component
Usage
You can use the countdown-timer component in your HTML by adding it as an element and providing the date attribute.

Example:

html
Copy code
<countdown-timer date="2024-12-31" expired-message="Time's up!">
    <span slot="days-label">Days Left</span>
    <span slot="hours-label">Remaining Hours</span>
    <span slot="minutes-label">Minutes Remaining</span>
    <span slot="seconds-label">Seconds Left</span>
</countdown-timer>
Attributes:
date: The target date for the countdown. You can use various formats (e.g., YYYY-MM-DD, DD/MM/YYYY).
expired-message: Custom message displayed when the countdown ends.
hide-days: Hides the days unit in the countdown.
hide-hours: Hides the hours unit in the countdown.
hide-minutes: Hides the minutes unit in the countdown.
hide-seconds: Hides the seconds unit in the countdown.
Customization
You can customize the labels for each unit (days, hours, minutes, seconds) by using slots. The default labels will be displayed if no content is provided in the slots.

Tabs Component
Usage
To create tabs, simply use the tabs-component element, which contains tab elements as children.

Example:

html
Copy code
<tabs-component>
    <tab label="Tab 1">Content for Tab 1</tab>
    <tab label="Tab 2">Content for Tab 2</tab>
    <tab label="Tab 3">Content for Tab 3</tab>
</tabs-component>
Customization
Each <tab> element has a label attribute, which defines the tab's name.
The content inside each <tab> will be shown when the corresponding tab is selected.
How It Works
Both the Countdown Timer and Tabs Component are built using Web Components, which means they encapsulate their functionality and styling, preventing conflicts with other parts of your application.

Countdown Timer
The timer is a custom element that calculates the difference between the current time and a specified target date.
You can customize its appearance, hide specific time units (e.g., days or hours), and use slots to update the labels dynamically.
Tabs Component
The Tabs component utilizes tab elements, each representing a tab with its content. When a tab is clicked, its corresponding content is displayed.
The component is flexible and can handle an arbitrary number of tabs.
Example
Hereâ€™s an example HTML page that uses both the Countdown Timer and Tabs Component:

html
Copy code
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Web Components Example</title>

</head>
<body>

    <!-- Countdown Timer -->
    <countdown-timer date="2024-12-31" expired-message="Time's up!">
        <span slot="days-label">Days Left</span>
        <span slot="hours-label">Remaining Hours</span>
        <span slot="minutes-label">Minutes Remaining</span>
        <span slot="seconds-label">Seconds Left</span>
    </countdown-timer>

    <!-- Tabs Component -->
    <tabs-component>
        <tab label="Tab 1">This is the content for Tab 1</tab>
        <tab label="Tab 2">This is the content for Tab 2</tab>
        <tab label="Tab 3">This is the content for Tab 3</tab>
    </tabs-component>

    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/Mohammedfouadd/web_component@cfa33415ec9b18bf6aa17c0014f63c71f96c479f/master.js"></script>
